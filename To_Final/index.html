            <p>Currently a Senior, Jack To is Graphic Design Major at CUI and has stayed for 4 years since he enrolled. 
                Past experiences that he has includes logo design, poster design and customer service which helped him grow maturely as a person and a designer.
                Having an experience in customer service allowed him to communicate more clearly with both his clients and teammates in reaching their goals but most importantly developing an interpersonal relationship skill.
                With his interpersonal relationship skill, Jack was able to learn more about his teammates and improved the efficiency of teamwork in hearing their problems and help them out both physically and mentally.
